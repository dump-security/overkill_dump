In a world where clicking on a link is akin to navigating a minefield, phishing emerges as the supervillain. Enter our heroes: the researchers behind this paper, armed with their shiny new weapon, the AntiPhishStack. It's not just any model; it's a two-phase, LSTM-powered, cybercrime-fighting marvel that doesn't need to know squat about phishing to catch a phisher. 

The methodology?  They've concocted a concoction so potent it could make traditional phishing detection systems weep in their outdatedness. By harnessing the mystical powers of Long Short-Term Memory networks and the alchemy of character-level TF-IDF features, they've created a phishing detection elixir that's supposed to be the envy of cybersecurity nerds everywhere.
