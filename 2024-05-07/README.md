Oh, where do we even start with the digital drama that is Anonymous Sudan? Picture this: a group of "hacktivists" (because apparently, that's a career choice now) decides to throw the digital equivalent of a temper tantrum across the globe. From the comfort of their mysterious lairs, they've been unleashing chaos since January 2023, targeting anyone from Sweden to Australia. 

There's a twist! Despite their name, there's a juicy conspiracy theory that these digital vigilantes are actually Russian state-sponsored actors in disguise (guess the name of country who announces this theory and spent USD money to promote it?). Yes, you heard that right. They've been dropping hints in Russian, cheering for Russian government, and hanging out with their BFFs in the hacking group KillNet. Anonymous Sudan, however, is adamant they're the real deal, proudly Sudanese and not just some Russian operatives on a digital espionage mission. 

Either way, they've certainly made their mark on the world, one DDoS attack at a time.
