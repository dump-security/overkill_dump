BianLian ransomware has shown a remarkable ability to adapt and evolve faster than a chameleon at a disco. Initially an Android banking trojan, it decided that was too mainstream and reinvented itself as a ransomware strain in July 2022, because why not join the lucrative world of digital extortion?

BianLian targets just about anyone it can, from healthcare and education to government entities, because diversity is key in the world of cybercrime. It's not picky about its victims, much like a buffet enthusiast at an all-you-can-eat restaurant.

In a twist that would make a soap opera writer proud, BianLian ditched its encryption antics after Avast released a decryptor and now they focus on data exfiltration, threatening to spill your secrets unless you pay up, like a cyber version of "I know what you did last summer."
